# Learning points
<!-- Learning points where you would write what you thought was helpful -->
Learning the syntax to bootstrap and how to set up the bootstrap grid system. The grid system allows for easy media queries, but it does not replace the need to add your own CSS media query. Learning the grid system helped me visualize a webpage in a more organized way.
